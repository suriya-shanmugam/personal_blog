In today’s world, where applications serve **millions of concurrent users**, delivering fast and reliable responses is non-negotiable. That’s where **load balancers** come in. Think of them as invisible traffic controllers sitting between users and servers, making sure every request is handled efficiently without overloading any single server.

## What is Load Balancing and Why Do We Need It?

**Load balancing** is the process of distributing network traffic across a pool of servers (resources) that host an application.  
Without it, one server could get overwhelmed while others sit idle, causing downtime, delays, and unhappy users.

A load balancer ensures:

- **Availability**  
  - Seamless **maintenance without downtime**  
  - **Disaster recovery** handling  
  - Continuous **health checks** to detect failed servers

- **Scalability**  
  - Effortlessly **add or remove servers** to handle traffic spikes or scale down during quiet periods  

In essence, load balancing keeps applications **resilient, scalable, and always online**.

## Types of Load Balancing

1. **Hardware-based Load Balancers**  
   - Dedicated appliances with high throughput, used in large enterprises.  
   - Expensive but extremely optimized.

2. **Software-based Load Balancers**  
   - Run on commodity hardware or cloud VMs.  
   - Popular examples: **HAProxy, NGINX, Envoy, Traefik**.  
   - Cloud-native: **AWS ELB/ALB, GCP Load Balancer, Azure Front Door**.

### Major Categories
- **Application-Level (Layer 7 / L7)** – HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC aware  
- **Network-Level (Layer 3/4)** – Operates on IP and TCP/UDP layers

## Load Balancing Algorithms

Load balancers use algorithms to decide **which server gets the next request**.

### 1. Static Methods
- **Round Robin** – Sequentially distributes requests across servers.  
- **Weighted Round Robin** – Assigns more traffic to higher-capacity servers.  
- **IP Hash** – Maps client IPs consistently to the same server.

### 2. Dynamic Methods
- **Least Connections** – Chooses the server with the fewest active connections.  
- **Weighted Least Connections** – Accounts for server capacity in addition to connections.  
- **Least Response Time** – Sends traffic to the fastest responder.  
- **Resource-Based Monitoring** – Routes based on CPU/memory load.

## Performance Difference Between L3/L4 and L7 Load Balancers

### Layer 4 (Transport Load Balancer)
- Operates at **TCP/UDP** level.  
- Makes decisions only on **IP and port**.  
- Does **not terminate connections** → acts like a **smart router**.  
- **Minimal overhead**, best for raw performance.  

### Layer 7 (Application Load Balancer)
- Operates at **HTTP/HTTPS/gRPC** level.  
- **Terminates client connections**, decrypts TLS if needed.  
- Parses headers (`Host`, `Path`, cookies) to make **content-aware routing decisions**.  
- Opens **new TCP connections** to backend servers.  
- Overhead exists because data is **copied and parsed**.  

#### Is there an “extra copy” of data?  
- **Yes, at L7** → requests are buffered/parsed.  
- **No, at L4** → packets are passed through transparently.  
- Modern proxies minimize this overhead with **zero-copy system calls** (`sendfile()`, `splice()`) and **streaming** instead of full buffering.

## Example: Request Flow in L7 Proxy (HAProxy / NGINX)

1. **Client → Load Balancer**  
   - Client sends `GET /api/users`.  
   - LB terminates TLS, parses headers.  

2. **Load Balancer → Backend**  
   - Routes `/api/*` → backend1.  
   - Opens a new HTTP connection.  
   - Streams request body directly to backend.  

3. **Backend → Load Balancer → Client**  
   - Response is proxied back.  
   - LB may add headers (`X-Forwarded-For`).  

---

## Practical Implications

- **Performance**:  
  - L4 = faster, lightweight.  
  - L7 = slightly heavier due to parsing & TLS.  

- **Flexibility**:  
  - L4 = great for raw TCP services (databases, game servers).  
  - L7 = ideal for APIs, web apps, microservices (content-based routing, TLS offload, authentication, caching).  

**Design choice boils down to speed vs flexibility.**

## Prototype: HAProxy + Python Flask Server

[Prototype Link](https://github.com/suriya-shanmugam/load-balancer)   
You can build a simple prototype to experiment with:

- **HAProxy** as the L7 load balancer.  
- **Flask** running multiple backend servers (`/api`, `/images`).  
- HAProxy routes traffic based on path rules.  

This setup helps visualize how requests flow through a **real-world load balancing pipeline**.

# Final Thoughts

Load balancers may be invisible, but they are **critical for modern distributed systems**.  
Choosing between **L4 vs L7** comes down to whether you need **performance (L4)** or **intelligence (L7)**.  

The best architectures often combine both, with **L4 for raw speed** and **L7 for smart routing & app awareness**.
